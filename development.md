# Psyna Game Development Notes

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the core components of the Psyna game, developed using vanilla JavaScript. The game is inspired by the classic "The Legend of Zelda" for NES and is built from scratch, focusing on modular and object-oriented design principles.

## File Structure
The game's codebase is divided into three main TypeScript files, each handling a specific aspect of the game:

### 1. `actor.ts`
- **Purpose**: Defines the `Actor` class and related interfaces (`Position`, `Size`).
- **Functionality**:
  - Represents characters or objects in the game world.
  - Associates each actor with a specific stage, position, and size.
  - Handles the actor's image representation.

### 2. `game.ts`
- **Purpose**: Sets up the overall game structure through the `Game` class.
- **Functionality**:
  - Manages the game's main elements like the stage and event handling.
  - Contains methods for initializing, starting, and accessing the game's stage and events.

### 3. `stage.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages the game environment or level with the `Stage` class.
- **Functionality**:
  - Handles the rendering of the game environment on a canvas element.
  - Manages mouse interactions and a collection of actors within the stage.

## Development Notes
- The project employs TypeScript for type safety and consistency.
- Emphasis is on modular design, with clear separation of concerns in different classes.
- Rendering is done using HTML canvas, suitable for 2D graphics.
- The game engine is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for further expansion and complexity.

## Future Considerations
- Enhancing the game engine to support more complex features like physics, animation, and AI.
- Implementing sound and music for a more immersive experience.
- Continuously optimizing performance and refining the game mechanics.
- Expanding the game with more levels, enemies, and puzzles.

## Feedback and Contributions
- Feedback on the current implementation is welcomed.
- Contributions to the project can be made via [GitHub link to the project].
